Inspired by the holy apostles of the indie startup community, [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/), [Jon Yongfook](https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html) and many others, I will be starting my own challenge. 

For the next 6 months i will be building and launching 6 niche job boards in 6 months.

### Why Niche Job Boards?
In my head Iâ€™ve rationalized that a job board is the simplest form of B2B internet business to start with.

For starters, it's relatively easy to code (there are even prebuilt templates for wordpress... but i will code my own stuff from scratch).

Second, everyone knows what a job board is, so the marketing is straight fordward. You don't need to explain the service to businesses and you can easily show them how you can add value.

Third, it's a useful service for job applicants, because you can speed up and streamline their job seeking.

### Problems and Assumptions
Just because job boards are simple and useful, doesn't mean that success is guaranteed! 

After all, i'm going to compete against giants like linkedin/indeed/monster.

But there are many successful niche job boards out there that make decent income so that's what I'm aiming at.

Perhaps all 6 of them are going to fail, but this is something I won't know for sure unless I try.

### Challenge Requirements for the 1st of August

all 6 job boards must be online and with the following features
 - a homepage displaying the latest jobs, with the top section containing the sponsored (paid) job posts
 - every job post must expand into a separate page, which has the full description, share buttons to share the job post on social media and the "apply" button
 - an email opt-in for people wanting daily or weekly jobs in their email
 - a way for me to manually add, delete and modify job posts
