Inspired by the holy apostles of the indie startup community, [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/), [Jon Yongfook](https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html) and many others, I will be starting my own challenge. 

For the next 6 months i will be building and launching 6 job boards in 6 months.


### Why Job Boards?

[tbc]

### Challenge Requirements for the 1st of August

all 6 job boards must be online and with the following features
 - a homepage displaying the latest jobs, with the top section containing the sponsored (paid) job posts
 - every job post must expand into a separate page, which has the full description, share buttons to share the job post on social media and the "apply" button
 - an email opt-in for people wanting daily or weekly jobs in their email
 - a way for me to manually add, delete and modify job posts
