Inspired by the holy apostles of the indie startup community, [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/), [Jon Yongfook](https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html) and many others, I will be starting my own challenge. 

For the next 6 months i will be building and launching 6 niche job boards in 6 months.

### Why Niche Job Boards?
In my head I've rationalized that a job board is the simplest form of B2B "software" project to begin with. 

For starters, everyone knows what a job board is, so no need to explain the service to people. This removes a layer of difficulty that many startup founders have.

Second, it's a useful service for companies because you can offer more qualified applicants for a lower price, and it's a useful service for job applicants, because you can speed up and streamline their job seeking. 

### Problems and Assumptions
Just because job boards are simple and useful, doesn't mean that success is guaranteed. After all Linkedin, indeed and monster are pretty good. 

But there are many successful niche job boards out there that make decent income so that's what I'm aiming at.

Perhaps all 6 of them are going to fail, but this is something I won't know for sure unless I try.

### Challenge Requirements for the 1st of August

all 6 job boards must be online and with the following features
 - a homepage displaying the latest jobs, with the top section containing the sponsored (paid) job posts
 - every job post must expand into a separate page, which has the full description, share buttons to share the job post on social media and the "apply" button
 - an email opt-in for people wanting daily or weekly jobs in their email
 - a way for me to manually add, delete and modify job posts
