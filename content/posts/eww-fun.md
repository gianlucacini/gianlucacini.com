Nowadays I see a lot of cool projects listed on the various product hunts/ycombinators of the world.

Cool, cool dude.

But I see building cool shit as a luxury. 

I don't want to sound like a boomer or a hypocrite, but most people in the world have absolutely soul crushing shit jobs. Every day millions of people wake up and head to their job full of resentment and hopelessness for the future.

I think about the time when i worked in a factory for 3 months, being treated like dirt, feeling like you are easily replecable and doing the same task over and over for 8 hours a day.



So yes, it's ok to work on boring businesses if your end goal is freedom.
