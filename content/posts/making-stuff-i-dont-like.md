Probably the most important question that you will answer in your lifetime is: what do you want to do when you grow up?

do you want to try your hand and become a successful guitar player? or prehaps you want to teach guitar classes and maybe play in a band in your spare time?

Do you burn the boats and shoot for the stars? or you take a more rational and safe approach?

For some people the choice is easy, for others it's hard

Ok so in the next months 

I have no idea about what I want to do, no particular skill or expertise except I know how to code.

All I know is that I want to break free from my 9-5 job and build things that I want to build.



Nowadays I see a lot of cool projects listed on the various product hunts/ycombinators of the world.

Cool, cool dude.

But I see building cool shit as a luxury. 

I don't want to sound like a boomer or a hypocrite, but most people in the world have absolutely soul crushing shit jobs. Every day millions of people wake up and head to their job full of resentment and hopelessness for the future.

I think about the time when i worked in a factory for 3 months, being treated like dirt, feeling like you are easily replecable and doing the same task over and over for 8 hours a day.



So yes, it's ok to work on boring businesses if your end goal is freedom.
