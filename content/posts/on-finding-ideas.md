Ok I am not a big fan of this part, particularly because there are a lot of homework-like tasks you need to do in order to gtfo this phase and get to the actual fun stuff which is building

## What are Your Goals

I think the journey to finding business ideas starts from defining your very own goals. 

For example, if you want to build the next revolutionary Web3 startup that will solve financial inequality, then perhaps you should hang out and network with engineers and academics, study hard, find VCs and raise rounds (I actually have no idea what you should be doing, I'm just filling this paragraph with words).

But instead, if all you want is to break free from a boring job, have more freedom, spend less time in front of a computer screen and more time with friends and family, then maybe the solution is a bootstrapped, solo founded internet business. No employees, no investors, no liabilities.

Defining your goal first and foremost helps you step on the right track.

Now let's dive into how to actually find a business idea.

## Start from a problem

identify a problem -> validate problem -> solve problem -> sell the solution to the problem 

These are the steps that literally every random business dude preaches. Nothing new here, very boring but it works, do not dismiss this method just because you have seen it a thousand times.

## Start from a domain name

I am stealing this method from [Peter Askew](https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/).

If you can't think of any particular problem right now and you need inspiration, perhaps buying a great .com domain can give you both a great idea for a business and instant authority in the space. 

Read the article, it's great.

## Start from an existing business model and copy and paste it to other niches

With business model i mean: 

- SaaS / XaaS (everything as a service)
- E-Commerce
- Info Products
- White Label Product Provider (like represent/teespring)
- White Label Service Provider (help companies outsource SEO, Web Development, etc...)
- Communities 
- Class-Ads (like job boards)

these models have been around for years, and there are still untapped niches. Businesses still need software and contractors to outsource excess work to, people still want to buy and sell things online, people still want to meet and connect with likeminded people etc etc. 

You might argue that these needs have already been met by other companies and that the market is saturated, and while that sometimes is true, other times you can earn a portion of the market share by making something easier to use / cheaper / with better customer service. 

## Start from the bad reviews of an an existing business

never tried it, but heard about this method many times. Simply browsing through the negative reviews of info or software products can give you an idea of what are they lacking and what can be done better.

## Do not spread yourself too thin

Our society rewards specialization more than generalization. If i hire a plumber, i couldn't care less if he plays the drums in his spare time, i want him to be great at plumbing.

I think the same is true in the startup world, therefore the best course of action would be, when finding ideas, concentrate only on one industry. 

## Just start

The most important part. Once you found enough ideas, it's time to turn off your brain and start building.

There will be many moments in which you will feel insecure, you will second guess yourself and you will be tempted to stop everything and chase after another idea. Do not do that. 

Only after you build -> launch -> market for some time you will eventually undestand if you failed or not. But do not quit too early.
