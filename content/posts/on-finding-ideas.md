Finding ideas... the cross and delight of every startup founder.

I am not a big fan of this part, particularly because there is a lot of homework-like tasks you need to do in order to gtfo this phase and start to actually build stuff: you have to validate your ideas, you have to check and study the competition, you have to check on google trends if people are actually searching for what you want to build etc etc.

Although I hate this part, this is also where i dabble the most. Big mistake.

I am a very insecure person and if I am not good at something right away, I get discouraged very easily. This is obviously not good because the first few months, any startup will probably be garbage no matter how much work gets put in.

## What are Your Goals

I think the journey to finding business ideas starts from defining your very own goals. 

For example, if you want to build the next revolutionary Web3 startup that will solve financial inequality, then perhaps you should hang out and network with other engineers and academics, study hard, find VCs and raise rounds (I actually have no idea what you should be doing, I'm just filling this paragraph with words).

If you are a small brain chimp like me, and all you want is to break free from your boring job, spend less time in front of a computer screen and more time with friends and family, and have less stress and more freedom, then maybe the solution is a bootstrapped, solo founded internet business. No employees, no investors, no liabilities.

Defining your goal first and foremost helps you step on the right track.

Now let's dive into how to actually find a business idea.

## Start from a problem

identify a problem -> validate problem -> solve problem -> sell the solution to the problem 

These are the steps that literally every random business dude preaches. Nothing new here, very boring but it works, do not dismiss this method just because you have seen it a thousand times.

## Start from a domain name

I am stealing this method from [Peter Askew](https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/).

If you can't think of any particular problem right now and you need inspiration, perhaps buying a great .com domain can give you both a great idea for a business and instant authority in the space. 

Read the article, it's great.

## Start from an existing business model and copy and paste it to other niches

With business model i mean: 

- SaaS / XaaS (everything as a service)
- E-Commerce
- Info Products
- White Label Product Provider (like represent/teespring)
- White Label Service Provider (help companies outsource SEO, Web Development, etc...)
- Communities 
- Class-Ads (like job boards)

these models have been around for years, and there are still untapped niches. Businesses still need software and contractors to outsource excess work to, people still want to buy and sell things online, people still want to meet and connect with likeminded people etc etc. 

You might argue that these needs have already been met by other companies and that the market is saturated, and while that sometimes is true, other times you can earn a portion of the market share by making something easier to use / cheaper / with better customer service. 

## Start from the bad reviews of an an existing business

never tried it, but heard about this method many times. Simply browsing through the negative reviews of info or software products can give you an idea of what are they lacking and what can be done better.

## Just start

As of today, december 1st 2021, I have committed to building and growing a couple of internet businesses for at least one year, no matter what happens.  

I won't dabble, I won't think my idea is dumb or not cool, I will just start without worrying about getting results, reaching kpi's, monthly impressions, revenue and social media likes.

Just Start.
