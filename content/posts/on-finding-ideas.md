Quick mockup about what i learned over the years about the process of finding business ideas 
## What are Your Goals

The journey to finding business ideas starts from defining your goals. 

Why? Because someone who wants to solve huge social issues like financial inequality or pollution will need to go through a different process than someone who just wants to achieve financial and personal freedom.

Sure, you might achieve financial freedom while solving social issues, but you might also gain a lot of negative stuff like stress, long work hours, haters etc.

Knowing your goals (what you want and what you don't want) helps you filter out the ideas you'll come up with.

## How to Find Ideas
### Start from a problem

identify a problem -> validate problem -> solve problem -> sell the solution to the problem 

These are the steps that literally every random business dude preaches. Nothing new here, very boring but it works, do not dismiss this method just because you have seen it a thousand times.

### Start from a domain name

I am stealing this method from [Peter Askew](https://www.deepsouthventures.com/build-a-side-business/).

If you can't think of any particular problem right now and you need inspiration, perhaps buying a great .com domain can give you both a great idea for a business and instant authority in the space. 

Read the article, it's great.

### Start from an existing business model and copy and paste it to other niches

With business model i mean: 

- SaaS / XaaS (everything as a service)
- E-Commerce
- Coaching
- Info Products
- Product Providing (like represent/teespring)
- Service Providing (SEO, Web Development, Copywriting etc...)
- Communities (Patreon groups, Discord groups, masterminds, slack chats etc...)
- Class-Ads (like craigslist, job boards etc...)

these models have been around for years, and there are still untapped niches. Businesses still need software and contractors to outsource excess work to, people still want to buy and sell things online, people still want to meet and connect with likeminded people etc etc. 

You might argue that these needs have already been met by other companies and that the market is saturated, and while that sometimes is true, other times you can earn a portion of the market share by making something easier to use / cheaper / with better customer service. 

### Start from the reviews of an an existing product/service

[Tim Ferriss Explaining How He Wrote The 4 Hour Chef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v47WEyeSMSA&t=427s) (the whole video is great)

Simply browse through the reviews of any product / service and see what they are doing well, what they are doing wrong, what's missing and what could be added, then use this information to create a better product / service.

## Do not spread yourself too thin

Our society rewards specialization more than generalization. If i hire a plumber, i couldn't care less if he plays the drums in his spare time, i want him to be great at plumbing.

I think the same is true in the startup world, therefore the best course of action would be, when finding ideas, concentrate only on one industry. 

## Just start

The most important part. Once you found enough ideas, it's time to turn off your brain and start building.

There will be many moments in which you will feel insecure, you will second guess yourself and you will be tempted to stop everything and chase after another idea. 

Understand that it's perfectly normal and let the temptation go.
