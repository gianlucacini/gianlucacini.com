A few months ago I inherited the domain cadjobs.com. As I had no idea what to do with it and being not so familiar with the world of cad. I decided to use this opportunity to learn something, so I created an aggregator of remote jobs focused on cad software (autocad, solidworks and the likes)

*link here >> [Cad Jobs](https://cadjobs.com)*

Stack:
- Blazor Interactive Server (.NET 8)
- MudBlazor
- MongoDB

Here's a few things I've learned after a few months of work

## Spend more time planning and less time coding
It may not be the most enjoyable aspect of the job, but dedicating more time to planning before diving into coding can save significant time and prevent numerous problems in the future.

Coding without prior planning might seem enjoyable initially, but I encountered numerous "oh shit, what about this" moments that necessitated going back to modify existing code. These issues could have been avoided if I had engaged in proper planning beforehand.

## Choose Your Stack Wisely
Are you doing this as a hobby or as a way to monetize your work? You should choose your Tech Stack depending on this answer.
If you are doing this for money and you have little time you should consider buying a wordpress theme or using the tech stack you are most comfortable with and just call it a day.

Otherwise, take this opportunity to learn something new.
